            <h2>Overview of Kidney Disease in Dogs</h2>
            <p>Kidney disease in dogs happens when the kidneys are no longer able to do their job properly. The kidneys filter waste products from the blood, balance fluids and electrolytes, help control blood pressure, and support red blood cell production. When they start to fail, waste and excess fluid build up in the body, affecting many organs at once.</p>
            <p>There are two main forms of kidney problems:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Acute kidney injury (AKI):</strong> kidney function drops suddenly over hours to days, often due to toxins, severe dehydration, or infection.</li>
                <li><strong>Chronic kidney disease (CKD):</strong> kidney function declines slowly over months or years, usually from age-related changes, inherited issues, immune-mediated disease, infections, or previous injury.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In both cases, symptoms can look quite similar. The difference is how quickly they appear and how easily they can be reversed. Recognising symptoms early gives the best chance of effective treatment and better quality of life.</p>

            <h2>Common Symptoms</h2>
            <p>Many owners first notice changes that seem minor or “just getting older,” but these can be early signs of kidney trouble. Common symptoms include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Increased thirst (polydipsia):</strong> you may see your dog at the water bowl more often or draining it faster than usual.</li>
                <li><strong>Increased urination (polyuria):</strong> larger puddles, more frequent pees, or needing to go out overnight.</li>
                <li><strong>Reduced appetite:</strong> turning away from food, eating more slowly, or being fussy with previously loved meals.</li>
                <li><strong>Weight loss:</strong> a gradual “slimming down,” ribs or spine becoming more noticeable.</li>
                <li><strong>Lethargy:</strong> more sleeping, less interest in walks and play, seeming “flat” or tired.</li>
                <li><strong>Bad breath:</strong> breath that smells stronger, sometimes described as metallic or urine-like.</li>
                <li><strong>Gastrointestinal upset:</strong> occasional vomiting, nausea, lip-licking, or drooling.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These symptoms are not specific to kidney disease and can be caused by other problems such as diabetes, liver disease, or hormonal conditions. Blood and urine tests are needed to know for sure.</p>

            <h2>Early Warning Signs</h2>
            <p>Kidney disease is often well advanced by the time obvious symptoms appear. Spotting subtle early changes can make a big difference to how quickly treatment starts.</p>
            <h3>Subtle Changes to Watch For</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mild increase in drinking:</strong> topping up the water bowl more often than you used to.</li>
                <li><strong>Needing to pee at night:</strong> a dog that previously slept through now wakes you to go outside.</li>
                <li><strong>Fussy appetite but still eating:</strong> some meals left in the bowl, preferring certain textures or toppings.</li>
                <li><strong>Slow, steady weight loss:</strong> harness or collar fitting looser even though you haven’t changed food amount.</li>
                <li><strong>Slight drop in energy:</strong> shorter walks, more resting after exercise, but still generally “okay.”</li>
                <li><strong>Changes in urine:</strong> very pale, very dilute urine, or occasional accidents indoors in a previously house-trained dog.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you notice one or more of these changes for more than a week or two, especially in a senior dog, it’s sensible to book a check-up and basic blood and urine tests. Early CKD may be easier to manage and can sometimes stay stable for a long time.</p>

            <h2>Advanced Symptoms</h2>
            <p>As kidney disease progresses, more obvious and sometimes distressing symptoms can develop. These are signs that the kidneys are struggling more, and urgent veterinary attention is needed.</p>
            <h3>Signs of More Advanced Kidney Disease</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Markedly poor appetite or refusal to eat:</strong> eating only treats or nothing at all.</li>
                <li><strong>Frequent vomiting or persistent nausea:</strong> repeated episodes, bile in vomit, or drooling and lip-licking without eating.</li>
                <li><strong>Severe weight loss and muscle wasting:</strong> prominent bones, loss of thigh or shoulder muscle.</li>
                <li><strong>Very bad breath and mouth ulcers:</strong> strong odour, drooling, pawing at the mouth, or blood-tinged saliva.</li>
                <li><strong>Weakness or wobbliness:</strong> difficulty jumping, climbing stairs, or standing for long periods.</li>
                <li><strong>Changes in urination pattern:</strong> very small volumes of urine, dark or blood-tinged urine, or complete lack of urine.</li>
                <li><strong>Swollen paws or belly:</strong> fluid build-up (oedema or ascites) in advanced cases.</li>
                <li><strong>Neurological signs:</strong> disorientation, tremors, twitching, or seizures in severe toxin build-up.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These signs usually indicate advanced disease or a sudden crisis on top of existing kidney problems. They are considered emergencies and warrant immediate veterinary assessment.</p>

            <h2>Diagnostic Methods</h2>
            <p>Because the symptoms of kidney disease overlap with many other conditions, proper diagnosis relies on tests rather than symptoms alone. Your vet will combine what you report at home with clinical examination and laboratory work.</p>
            <h3>How Vets Diagnose Kidney Disease</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>History:</strong> changes in drinking, urination, appetite, weight, behaviour, and any vomiting or diarrhoea.</li>
                <li><strong>Physical exam:</strong> checking hydration, weight, muscle condition, mouth and gums, abdomen, heart, and blood pressure.</li>
                <li><strong>Blood tests:</strong> measuring creatinine, urea/BUN, SDMA, phosphorus, electrolytes, and sometimes red blood cell count and other organ values.</li>
                <li><strong>Urinalysis:</strong> checking how concentrated the urine is, testing for protein, blood, glucose, crystals, and signs of infection.</li>
                <li><strong>Urine protein:creatinine ratio (UPC):</strong> assessing how much protein is being lost through the kidneys.</li>
                <li><strong>Imaging:</strong> ultrasound or X-rays to look at kidney size and structure and rule out stones, cysts, or obstructions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These results are often used with established guidelines to stage chronic kidney disease or grade acute kidney injury. Staging helps predict likely progression and choose the most appropriate treatment plan.</p>

            <h2>Treatment Options</h2>
            <p>Symptoms guide not only diagnosis but also treatment. The type and intensity of treatment depends on whether the disease is acute or chronic, how advanced it is, and how your dog is feeling day to day.</p>
            <h3>Symptom-Focused Treatment</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fluid therapy:</strong> intravenous fluids in hospital or subcutaneous fluids at home to correct dehydration and support circulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Renal-support diet:</strong> specially formulated food with controlled protein, low phosphorus, and controlled sodium to reduce kidney workload.</li>
                <li><strong>Anti-nausea medications:</strong> to reduce vomiting and nausea, helping dogs feel well enough to eat.</li>
                <li><strong>Appetite stimulants:</strong> to encourage eating in dogs who are reluctant but still able to eat.</li>
                <li><strong>Blood pressure management:</strong> medications to control high blood pressure, which is common in kidney disease.</li>
                <li><strong>Proteinuria control:</strong> drugs such as ACE inhibitors or other agents to reduce protein loss in urine when present.</li>
                <li><strong>Phosphate binders:</strong> used when blood phosphorus remains high despite a renal diet.</li>
                <li><strong>Pain relief and supportive care:</strong> kidney-safe pain medications, gut protectants, and other supportive measures.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In emergency situations or severe acute kidney injury, more intensive treatments such as hospitalisation, continuous monitoring, and, in some centres, dialysis may be needed. Regardless of stage, the aim is to reduce uncomfortable symptoms and maintain the best possible quality of life.</p>

            <h2>FAQs</h2>

            <strong>Q: What are the initial signs of kidney disease in dogs?</strong>
            <p>A: Early signs can be subtle. Many owners first notice their dog drinking more water, urinating larger volumes or more often, losing a bit of weight, or becoming fussier with food. Mild lethargy and slightly stronger breath odour are also common. These changes may develop slowly, so it helps to pay attention to daily routines and mention any trends to your vet.</p>

            <strong>Q: How can I tell if my dog is experiencing kidney issues?</strong>
            <p>A: You can’t confirm kidney disease at home, but clues include increased thirst and urination, reduced appetite, gradual weight loss, more sleeping, and occasional vomiting or nausea. Changes in urine (very pale, very dilute, or much more than usual) can also be a sign. If you notice these changes lasting more than a few days, especially in an older dog, a vet visit and blood/urine tests are recommended.</p>

            <strong>Q: Are certain breeds more susceptible to kidney disease?</strong>
            <p>A: Any breed can develop kidney disease, but some breeds have a higher risk of inherited or structural kidney problems. Examples often mentioned include Bull Terriers, Shih Tzus, Lhasa Apsos, Soft-Coated Wheaten Terriers, and some spaniel and retriever breeds. Mixed-breed dogs are not immune, and age-related or acquired kidney disease is common in seniors of all breeds.</p>

            <strong>Q: What changes in behavior should I watch for in my dog?</strong>
            <p>A: Behaviour changes can include sleeping more, reluctance to exercise, slowing down on walks, hiding or seeking more quiet time, irritability when handled, or seeming “not quite themselves.” You might also see increased restlessness at night due to needing to urinate, or pacing and panting if they feel nauseous or uncomfortable.</p>

            <strong>Q: How is kidney disease diagnosed in dogs?</strong>
            <p>A: Kidney disease is diagnosed with a combination of history, physical examination, blood tests, and urine tests. Blood tests look at kidney markers such as creatinine, urea/BUN, and SDMA, as well as electrolytes and other organ values. Urinalysis assesses how concentrated the urine is and checks for protein, blood, crystals, or infection. Imaging and blood pressure measurements may also be used to refine diagnosis and staging.</p>

            <strong>Q: What treatment options are available for dogs with kidney disease?</strong>
            <p>A: Treatment options include kidney-supportive diets, fluid therapy, medications to control blood pressure and protein loss in urine, phosphate binders, anti-nausea and appetite-stimulating drugs, and sometimes home fluid administration. In acute or severe cases, hospitalisation with intravenous fluids and intensive monitoring is often needed. The exact plan depends on the cause, severity, and how your dog responds.</p>

            <strong>Q: Can kidney disease in dogs be prevented?</strong>
            <p>A: Not all kidney disease can be prevented, especially age-related or genetic forms. However, you can reduce risk by keeping toxins and human medications safely stored, providing constant access to fresh water, treating infections promptly, avoiding unnecessary use of kidney-stressing drugs, and scheduling regular health checks for senior dogs. Early detection allows earlier intervention, which may slow progression.</p>

            <strong>Q: How does kidney disease affect a dog's overall health?</strong>
            <p>A: Because the kidneys play a central role in filtering waste and regulating fluids and electrolytes, kidney disease can affect almost every system in the body. Dogs may feel tired and nauseous, lose weight and muscle, develop high blood pressure, anaemia, or changes in heart function, and show behaviour changes due to discomfort or toxin build-up. Managing kidney disease is about supporting the whole dog, not just the kidneys.</p>

            <strong>Q: When should I take my dog to the vet for kidney concerns?</strong>
            <p>A: You should book a vet appointment if you notice increased drinking or urination, reduced appetite, weight loss, or new lethargy lasting more than a few days. Emergency care is needed if your dog stops eating entirely, vomits repeatedly, seems very weak or collapses, produces very little urine, or shows signs of pain or distress. Trust your instincts—if something feels off, it is safer to have your dog checked.</p>

            <strong>Q: Is kidney disease in dogs treatable or curable?</strong>
            <p>A: Many causes of acute kidney injury are at least partially treatable, especially if caught early, and some dogs make a good recovery. Chronic kidney disease is usually not curable because the damage develops over time and is often irreversible. However, it is often very manageable. With the right diet, medications, and monitoring, many dogs with CKD can enjoy a good quality of life for months or years.</p>
